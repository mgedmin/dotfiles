# Support for $PWD detection in modern gnome-terminal
#
# Since version 3.10 gnome-terminal doesn't play games with /proc to find out
# the current working directory of the running shell, instead it wants the
# shell to tell it, by echoing an escape sequence.
#
# There's /etc/profile.d/vte.sh that sets up PROMPT_COMMAND to echo what's
# needed.  Only gnome-terminal doesn't launch login shells by default AFAICT,
# so /etc/profile.d is not executed for each tab.  And while the X session
# does source the profile, it doesn't do that in a terminal, so the "are
# we running under VTE" check in vte.sh fails and it bails early.

    if [ "${VTE_VERSION:-0}" -ge 3405 ]; then
