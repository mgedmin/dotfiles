# init string: replaces \E[?47h (use alt screen) with \E[?47l (use normal
# screen)
# exit string: adds "go to top; clear screen" to the beginning (gnome-terminal
# does this without losing scrollback history), drops the \E8 (cursor position
# restore) since the screen is clear and we're good at the top-left thanks.
